# About AirPaste

Have you ever wanted to send a long text (for example An Ethereum wallet address or a long text document) to your phone from your computer? If yes I think you how inconvenient to send it via email or using other messaging apps. Then you copy and finally paste it.

It can be a long process. The application I created makes this process faster and easier.

How does it work? There is a WebSocket server running in the background on the sender side. Every device has an IP address. This needs to be set on the application settings. You can see your deviceâ€™s IP address in the application settings menu. You need to set it on the other devices. If you want two-way communication then you need to set it all of your devices.
AirPaste ensures fast communication between your devices on your local network.
